# RSA Encryption Algorithm

Encryption techniques are used to ensure secure data transmission and guarantee user privacy. 
By using encryption, information is converted from plain text to a secret code, and only the intended user who has the key can access the information.
An RSA user generates a public key based on two large prime numbers along with a random value
makes and publishes publicly. Anyone can enter this public key for encryption.
But only the one who knows the first two numbers on which the key is based, is able to decode the message. There is no published method to defeat this system
